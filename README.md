Most of the projects are audio, although one generates modulated RF.
List of projects included on this page:

- IIR Audio filters (2, 4, and 6-pole, 47 kHz sample rate ):
- 18-bit, fixed point FSM
- 27-bit, fixed point FSM
- 18-bit, fixed point using a cpu
- 18-bit, fixed point using parallel pipeline
- 18-bit floating point using Second Order Sections (SOS)
- (To do: second order sections, FIR, multiple filters in one state machine )
- 16-bit fixed point CIC (cascaded integrator-comb)
- Soft Radio Transmitters: AM, FM
- Physical (Karplus-Strong) String synthesis
- DDS, Noise and FM sound synthesis
- Adaptive noise cancellation
- Audio CODEC documentation
